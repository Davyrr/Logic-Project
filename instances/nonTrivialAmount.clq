I could not find an instance which takes at least 10 seconds to run, 
but to find one, tried to create a graph generator and give the 
number of vertices and density, so it can create graphs and
we can check their running time on glucose. We could start with 
100 vertices and 0.75 density,and if glucose solves it under
10 seconds, we can increase the density and the number of vertices, 
eventually finding a graph running longer than 10 seconds.
